## Overview

Coral Greif is a naval warfare strategy game inspired by the classic game of Battleship. Set in the Pacific theater of World War II, you command a fleet of five warships against enemy forces. Your objective: locate and sink all enemy vessels before they sink yours.

The game requires no luck. Just deduction, pattern recognition, and the nerve to commit to a target.

## Getting Started

### Creating Your Profile

When you first launch Coral Greif, you'll create a player profile:

1. Enter your commander name (or accept the default)
2. Choose an avatar (optional)
3. Tap "Begin Service"

Your profile tracks your career statistics: games won, games lost, accuracy rating, and ships sunk. These persist between sessions.

### Your First Game

1. From the main menu, tap **New Game**
2. Select **vs AI** for single-player
3. Choose your difficulty level
4. Place your ships on the grid
5. Begin combat

## Game Rules

### The Battlefield

Each player has a 10x10 grid representing their ocean territory. Columns are labeled A through J. Rows are numbered 1 through 10. Every cell can be referenced by its coordinate (e.g., "B7" or "J10").

### Ship Placement

Before combat begins, you must position your five ships on your grid:

| Ship | Size | Historical Name |
|------|------|-----------------|
| Carrier | 5 cells | USS Enterprise |
| Battleship | 4 cells | USS Missouri |
| Cruiser | 3 cells | USS Indianapolis |
| Submarine | 3 cells | USS Wahoo |
| Destroyer | 2 cells | USS Johnston |

**Placement Rules:**
- Ships occupy consecutive cells in a straight line
- Ships can be oriented horizontally or vertically
- Ships cannot overlap
- Ships cannot extend beyond the grid boundaries
- Ships cannot be moved once combat begins

### Combat Phase

Players alternate turns. On your turn:

1. Select a coordinate on the enemy grid
2. Tap to fire
3. Observe the result: **Hit** or **Miss**
4. If you sink a ship, you'll be notified which type

**Turn Timer:** You have 20 seconds to make your move. If the timer expires, a random valid coordinate is selected automatically. This keeps the game moving.

### Victory Conditions

The game ends when one player sinks all five enemy ships. There are no draws. Someone always loses.

## Game Modes

### vs AI

Battle against computer-controlled opponents. Three difficulty levels available:

**Ensign (Easy)**
- AI fires randomly
- No pattern recognition
- Good for learning the game

**Commander (Normal)**
- AI uses hunt-and-target strategy
- Follows up on hits intelligently
- Fair challenge for most players

**Admiral (Hard)**
- Advanced probability calculations
- Optimal targeting patterns
- Will exploit predictable ship placements

### vs Human (Coming Soon)

Local multiplayer via pass-and-play or online multiplayer via Game Center. This feature is under development.

## Your Fleet

### USS Enterprise (Carrier)

The largest vessel in your fleet at 5 cells. Named after the most decorated U.S. Navy ship of World War II, CV-6 Enterprise participated in more major engagements against Japan than any other ship.

*Tactical note: Large ships are easier to hit but harder to sink completely. Place them where they're not the first thing found.*

### USS Missouri (Battleship)

Four cells of American steel. The "Mighty Mo" is where Japan formally surrendered on September 2, 1945, ending World War II.

*Tactical note: Mid-sized ships often survive longest. Not small enough to hide easily, not large enough to be priority targets.*

### USS Indianapolis (Cruiser)

Three cells. CA-35 Indianapolis delivered components for the atomic bombs used against Japan. Her loss after a Japanese torpedo attack remains the U.S. Navy's worst single-ship disaster.

*Tactical note: Three-cell ships can fit in gaps your opponent might overlook.*

### USS Wahoo (Submarine)

Three cells. SS-238 Wahoo, under Commander Dudley "Mush" Morton, was one of the most successful submarines in U.S. Navy history.

*Tactical note: Submarines and cruisers have identical sizes. Placing them differently forces opponents to guess which they've found.*

### USS Johnston (Destroyer)

Two cells. DD-557 Johnston, under Commander Ernest Evans, engaged a vastly superior Japanese force at the Battle off Samar. Evans received the Medal of Honor posthumously.

*Tactical note: Your smallest ship is your most valuable. It can hide in the smallest gaps. Save it for last if you can.*

## Strategy Tips

### Placement Strategy

1. **Avoid the edges.** New players often place ships along borders. Experienced opponents check edges first.

2. **Avoid clustering.** Ships placed adjacent to each other are found together. Spread them out.

3. **Break patterns.** If you always place ships horizontally, your opponent will catch on.

4. **Use the middle.** The center of the grid has more adjacent cells, but it's also where opponents often forget to look.

### Targeting Strategy

1. **Hunt mode.** Fire at cells in a checkerboard pattern. This guarantees you'll hit every ship with minimum shots.

2. **Target mode.** When you score a hit, fire adjacent cells to determine orientation, then follow the line.

3. **Count cells.** Track which ships you've sunk. If only the destroyer remains, don't waste shots where a 2-cell ship can't fit.

4. **Probability thinking.** Some cells can contain more possible ship placements than others. The center has more options than corners.

### General Tips

- The first player is chosen randomly. This is fair.
- If you're losing, you're not thinking. The game is deterministic once ships are placed.
- Watch the timer. A rushed shot is better than a random one.
